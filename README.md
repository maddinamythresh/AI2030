## üõ† Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Step 1 (Optional): Clean the Document
- Open the linked document.
- Remove all unnecessary text.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Step 2 (Optional): Save as Text File
- Download the cleaned version of the document as `text.txt`.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Step 3: Ensure Python is Installed
Run the following command to check your Python version:

```bash
python --version
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Step 4: Choose the Correct Python Script
- Use the appropriate script based on how you've handled the document:
  - If you cleaned the document and saved it as `text.txt`, use: **`AI2030Code.py`**
  - If you're using the original document without changes, use: **`FinalCode.py`**

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Step 5: Set File Path (Only for `AI2030Code.py`)
- If using `AI2030Code.py`, update the script with the correct file path to your `text.txt` file:

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Step 6: Run the Script
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where your Python script is located.
- Run the script with one of the following commands:

```bash
python AI2030Code.py
# or
python FinalCode.py
